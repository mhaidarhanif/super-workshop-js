# Super Group Work JS :gear: Group Work with JavaScript

> This is a short practical guide on why, how, and what to do during group work.

## Action Plan

### Why do we need a guide?

Quality application needs to be guided, to bring more extra attention to deliverables that can delight us from developers to the end users. That's why.

### How are we going to do it?

By following these objectives. That's how.

### What are the minimum objectives?

**First Project**

- Taking attention to the main deliverables.
- Documenting the plan thoroughly before creating any code. It's highly recommended to write a README with proper Markdown syntaxes.
- Practicing agile methodology with Scrum and Kanban. Report the progress at least every 1 hour.
- Drafting some backlog and point of main features, then sort them out. For every major task, create an issue.
- Differentiating branches or even repos when separating our tasks. Forking the repo is even better approach.
- Architecting the app based on analysis that has been concluded by team.
- Creating a more-than-just-CRUD app, utilizing web api that connects server and client apps.
- Features: Documentation, Server and Client, RESTful Web API, SQL or NoSQL Database, Authentication + JWT
- Tools: Git, Markdown, Atom, GitHub, ZenHub, cURL/Postman, Postico/Robomongo

**Second Project**

- Employing the benefits of testing to make sure our application is stable.
- Use principles like single responsibility, loose coupling, and separation of concerns.
- Covering the app functionalities within isolated environment of test.
- Improving code quality with code review and analysis service. Improve your grade by following the suggestions.
- Bringing the app design to various device dimensions.
- Features: Modular, AJAX, File Upload, CSS Preprocessor, Responsive + Grid, Unit + API Testing
- Tools: jQuery, Mocha, Chai + chai-http, Axios/SuperAgent, Web Storage, Less/Stylus

**Third Project**

- Gettting Test-Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to work.
- Making sure the UI is behaving as expected.
- Expediting the development workflow to the most effective and efficient possible.
- Automating consistent testing with Continuous Integration that results whether the app is pass or broken.
- Versioning or even tagging the app properly.
- Features: TDD/BDD, UI Testing, Spies/Stubs/Mocks, Continuous Integration (CI)
- Tools: Selenium/Nightmare, Travis/Jenkins CI

## Specifics to Agile/Scrum/Kanban

- Must follow practices of Scrum or Kanban, preparation for final project.
- Must divide the tasks/roles to each member in clear definition.
- Must arrange targets to super ultimate very mini small sprint per 1 hour.
- Must use artifact like backlog and story point. Even better, burndown chart.
- Must use board to visualize the progress better. We can use sticky notes, GitHub Projects, ZenHub, Trello, or other if needed.
